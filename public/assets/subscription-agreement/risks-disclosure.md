### Risks

I have evaluated the risks of investing in the Company and hereby attest that all of the following statements are true and correct:

1. I understand that the Private Placement Memorandum is very important and I have read the entire document along with the entire Limited Partnership Agreement and this Subscription Agreement and confirm that all documents that I have requested to satisfy my own due diligence inquiry regarding the Property and the General Partner has been made available. I have been able to ask questions of the General Partner and have been supplied with such additional information concerning this investment requested; and

2. I recognize that an investment in the Company involves substantial risks and I have taken full cognizance of and understand all risks related to the purchase of Units, including, but not limited to, those set forth in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in the offering materials. I am aware that this investment is highly speculative and I am capable of bearing the degree of economic risks and burdens of this investment, including, without limitation, the possibility of a complete loss of all contributed capital, and the lack of a public market to the extent it might not be possible to liquidate this investment; and

3. The offer to sell Units was directly communicated to me in a manner such that I was able to ask questions and receive satisfactory answers concerning the terms and conditions of this transaction, and, at no time was I presented with or solicited for this investment by any promotional meeting, newspaper, magazine, radio or television advertisement or any other form of general advertising; and

4. These Units are being acquired for my own account, or the account of the entity I represent, solely for investment, and are not being purchased with a view to or for the resale, distribution, division or fractionalization thereof; and

5. These Units, or any interest therein, will not be resold, either to an assignee or to a transferee, unless the Units are subsequently registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and appropriate state securities laws, or unless, among other conditions set forth in the Limited Partnership Agreement, and (i) an exemption from registration is available, (ii) any such resale will not cause a termination of the Company for tax purposes, (iii) similar warranties as are set forth in this Agreement are obtained from any such assignee or transferee and (iv) the written approval of the Company (which may be withheld and/or may require a satisfactory legal opinion regarding the availability of such exemption) to any Substitute Membership is previously obtained; and

6. I am able to bear the economic risk that any investment in the Company could become completely worthless.
