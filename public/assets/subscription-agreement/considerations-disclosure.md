### Considerations

**I am aware of all of the following:**

1. The Company has no financial or operating history;

2. There are substantial restrictions on the transferability of the Units which may not be re-sold or transferred in any event for at least one year from the date of the initial sale and only then may be sold or transferred pursuant to the transfer requirements described in the Limited Partnership Agreement; furthermore, the Units will not be, and Investors in the Company have no rights to require that the Units be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, or any other state or federal act, and any such registration is unlikely;

3. Financial projections and forecasts, if any, in the materials provided by the General Partner are only management's estimates based on assumptions therein stated. There is no assurance or guarantee that any such projections and forecasts will be met;

4. At any time, the amount of distributions or tax effects, that may be available as a result of investment in the Company, is not susceptible to absolute prediction, and different future occurrences, interpretations or new developments in rulings of the Internal Revenue Service, court decisions or legislative changes may have an adverse effect thereon;

5. No federal or state agency has made any finding or determination as to the fairness for public investment, nor any recommendation nor endorsement, of the Units;

6. I recognize that the Company will be subject to various conflicts of interest arising out of its relationship with the General Partner and Affiliates of the General Partner. I understand that the agreements and arrangements including those relating to compensation of the General Partner by the Company are not the result of arm's length negotiations. I understand the Company will not have independent administrative management and will rely upon the General Partner and Affiliates of the General Partner for management;

7. I understand that the General Partner has retained legal counsel who has prepared the Limited Partnership Agreement and that such attorney solely represents the Company or the General Partner, and has not agreed to represent any of the Company Limited Partners. I have been advised to seek my own legal counsel. I have access to adequate legal counsel, and to the extent desired have received advice from my own independent legal counsel and have relied exclusively thereon;

8. I understand that the General Partner may receive substantial compensation pursuant to the Limited Partnership Agreement. I have reviewed the interests and compensation to the General Partner and am satisfied that such is reasonable in connection with the Company and my purchase of interests therein; and

9. I understand that the offering materials supersede any other facts or assumptions that may have been represented, guaranteed, or warranted to me by any person, expressly or by implication, in any way connected with or related to this Offering.
